This Partner Solution reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Docker Enterprise Edition (Standard/Advanced) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Partner Solutions] are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to launch, configure, and run the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS.

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) is an integrated solution that includes open source and commercial software, the integrations between them, full Docker API support, validated configurations, and commercial support for your Docker EE environment. A pluggable architecture allows flexibility in the compute, networking, and storage providers that are used in your containers as a service (CaaS) infrastructure. The open APIs allow Docker EE to easily integrate into your existing systems, such as LDAP/AD, monitoring, logging, and more.

Docker Enterprise Edition has two main components: Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). 

* https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/1.1/overview/[UCP] is an enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker that helps you manage your whole cluster from a single place. UCP includes the UCP controllers and UCP nodes.
* https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.4/guides/[DTR] is the enterprise-grade image storage solution from Docker that helps you securely store and manage the Docker images you use in your applications. DTR is deployed in a three-node configuration that includes one DTR master and two DTR replicas.

This Partner Solution provides a reference architecture for Docker Enterprise Edition that you can deploy and use on AWS.
